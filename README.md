TPAMI'23: Evaluating Classification Model Against Bayes Error Rate

## Introduction:

This is the code repository to reproduce the experiments in the paper **[Evaluating Classification Model Against Bayes Error Rate]
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10027467)**. This repository is based on numpy, scipy and [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

## Prerequisite

We implement our methods by Python 3.8. The environment is as bellow:

- Anaconda 3  
- Linux operating system or Windows operating system  
- Sklearn, numpy
